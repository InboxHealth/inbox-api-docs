# Inbox Health Partner API

## Introduction

Logging in to our Partner Portal at inboxhealth.com/partner will immediately bring you to your "Account Settings" page. To get started authenticating yourself to our REST API, you'll need to generate your user account's API Key. At the bottom left of the "Account Settings" page, click the "View API Key" button on the left and re-enter your password to see your Inbox Health API Key. Keep this key in a safe place, preferably in a secure key store, as it grants full access to the Inbox Health API and can access any of the Inbox Health data managed by medical enterprises under your control.

The full specification of the Inbox Health Partner REST API documentation is available at [demo.inboxhealth.com/api](http://demo.inboxhealth.com/api) .  This page, automatically generated by OpenAPI (formerly known as the Swagger Specification) has all of the main model resources listed on the page should expand with the valid operations that can be performed against each one.  While logged into the partner portal, notice that you can perform any of the API actions by supplying parameters and hitting the "Try It." This works because the API falls back to cookie-based authentication if the "Authorization" HTTP Header is not present. Feel free to experiment with these, but also note that the User Interface at [demo.inboxhealth.com/partner](http://demo.inboxhealth.com/partner) also utilizes these exact requests to render your information in this UI, so feel free to use your Web Browser's Networks tab in its Developer Tools to explore how you can use some of its requests.
  
## First Requests
I'll be emailing you a detailed instructions that document the first use case, which would outline how to POST and create first an "Enterprise" along with its child "Practices" (locations) using the POST /enterprises resource, and then how to subsequently post new "Patient" models that belong to that Enterprise. For now, I'd recommend trying to send a basic Enterprise with one sub "Practice" (facility) to the following endpoint:  

  

[demo.inboxhealth.com/api/partner/v2/enterprises](http://demo.inboxhealth.com/api/partner/v2/enterprises)  

  

  

JSON Body:

  

  

{  
"enterprise": {  
"name": "Mental Health/Substance Abuse Medical ",  
"city": "New Haven",  
"state": "CT",  
"address_line_1": "770 Chapel St",  
"address_line_2": null,  
"zip": "06512",  
"support_phone_number": "(203) 415-3486",  
"sales_tax": 0,  
"default_quick_pay_description": "Copay",  
"logo_background_color": null,  
"default_checkin_routes": null,  
"statement_descriptor": "BANK STATEMENT DESCRIPTOR OVERRIDE",  
"time_zone": "Eastern Time (US & Canada)",  
"color_statements": true,  
"first_class": true,  
"return_envelope": true,  
"perforation": true,

"practices_attributes": [{  
"name": "My First Mental Health Facility",  
"address_line_1": "Address line 1 placeholder",  
"city": "City Placeholder",  
"state": "New York",  
"time_zone": "Eastern Time (US & Canada)"  
}]  
}  
}  

  

After this request is successful, you could try adding patients to this medical enterprise with the following Post:

  

{  
"patient":{  
"first_name":"Test First Name",  
"last_name":"Test Last Name",  
"date_of_birth":"1987-07-23",  
"sex":"Male",  
"email":"[testemail@inboxhealth.com](mailto:testemail@inboxhealth.com)",  
"**enterprise_id**": <<Enterprise ID returned above>>  
}  
}  
  

We're currently working on more documentation, but between these initial examples and the swagger docs I hope you'll be able to get a decent start the feel of the API itself. Don't hesitate to contact us either by email or Slack for quicker responses in our new mutual channe

  

  

  

Looking forward to working with you!

## Authentication
Inbox Health's API utilizes "HTTP Basic Authentication" with the API key acting as the username in each request.

Add the API Key you generated via the Partner portal above to each HTTP request as your Username via HTTP Basic Authentication.  If you are unfamiliar with this practice and do not  have a HTTP client that supports Basic Authentication on requests, you can implement yourself pretty easily by adding the header
``` 
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```
 where `<credentials>` is your API Key with a colon suffix, base 64 encoded i.e. `<API_KEY>:` .
