# Inbox Health Partner API

This document is meant to accompany and provide a user-friendly overview of the full specifications of the Inbox Health Partner REST API, fully-documented at inboxhealth.com/api.  Plea

## Introduction

Logging in to our Partner Portal at inboxhealth.com/partner will immediately bring you to your "Account Settings" page. To get started authenticating yourself to our REST API, you'll need to generate your user account's API Key. At the bottom left of the "Account Settings" page, click the "View API Key" button on the left and re-enter your password to see your Inbox Health API Key. Keep this key in a safe place, preferably in a secure key store, as it grants full access to the Inbox Health API and can access any of the Inbox Health data managed by medical enterprises under your control.

The full specification of the Inbox Health Partner REST API documentation is available at [demo.inboxhealth.com/api](http://demo.inboxhealth.com/api) .  This page, automatically generated by OpenAPI (formerly known as the Swagger Specification) has all of the main model resources listed on the page should expand with the valid operations that can be performed against each one.  While logged into the partner portal, notice that you can perform any of the API actions by supplying parameters and hitting the "Try It." This works because the API falls back to cookie-based authentication if the "Authorization" HTTP Header is not present. Feel free to experiment with these, but also note that the User Interface at [demo.inboxhealth.com/partner](http://demo.inboxhealth.com/partner) also utilizes these exact requests to render your information in this UI, so feel free to use your Web Browser's Networks tab in its Developer Tools to explore how you can use some of its requests.

## Authentication
Inbox Health's API utilizes "HTTP Basic Authentication" with the API key acting as the username in each request.

Add the API Key you generated via the Partner portal above to each HTTP request as your Username via HTTP Basic Authentication.  If you are unfamiliar with this practice and do not  have a HTTP client that supports Basic Authentication on requests, you can implement yourself pretty easily by adding the header
``` 
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```
 where `<credentials>` is your API Key with a colon suffix, base 64 encoded i.e. `<API_KEY>:` .
